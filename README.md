# TokenTransmogs
<p>Adds a "collected" indicator on tier token tooltips associated with each class to see which appearances you can collect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the covered tiers:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>Nerub-Ar Palace</p>
<p>Amirdrassil</p>
<p>Aberrus</p>
<p>Vault of the Incarnates</p>
<p>Sepulcher of the First Ones</p>
<p>Siege of Orgrimmar</p>
<p>Throne of Thunder</p>
<p>Terrace of Endless Spring / Heart of Fear</p>
<p>Dragon Soul</p>
<p>Firelands</p>
<p>Throne of the Four Winds / Bastion of Twilight / Blackwing Descent</p>
<p>Ulduar</p>
<p>Naxxramas</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some may not be covered or are not possible to cover, such as tokens with many, many appearances tied to them. I may instead one day do something like "X appearances uncollected", but for now this is just most core raid drop tokens.</p>
